        fashion shop in various ways. The specific personal information we

      <h2 id="InfoGuard">2. Securing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        At OldSoulStyle, your privacy is our top priority. However, it should be
        noted that no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage
        can be completely secure. While we have robust measures in place, we
        cannot guarantee the full security of your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="InfoProtection">3. Protecting Customer Data</h2>

      <p>
        We only disclose customer data to our staff and authorized entities who
        require such information to facilitate retro fashion shopping
        transactions through our platform. These entities may be located outside
        your country, and by using OldSoulStyle's vintage fashion shopping
        services, you consent to this data transfer. We disclose data in
        compliance with legal obligations or when necessary to protect the
        rights of OldSoulStyle and the customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Customers may occasionally receive information about new vintage
        arrivals, special offers, and OldSoulStyle updates. Our online store
        serves as our primary communication platform, reducing the frequency of
        direct emails. We take all necessary measures to prevent unauthorized
        access or misuse of personal data.
