        Members may occasionally receive information about new fitness programs,
        special offers, and Spartanum Gym updates. Our online platform serves as
        our primary communication platform, reducing the frequency of direct
        emails. We take all necessary measures to prevent unauthorized access or
        misuse of personal data.
