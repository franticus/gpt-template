            information, and the choices accessible to our Users concerning this
            matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy is an extension of our Website's Terms of
            Service. EsportsEdge respects your privacy and reassures you that
            any information shared by you with EsportsEdge is securely protected

            <strong>Our Process of Collecting Information</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Users are required to register with us in order to place bets and
            access our services. We collect the personal information of our
            Users, such as their names, addresses, email addresses, and phone

            access to our betting services may be restricted. We also collect
            non-personal information, like your IP address. This information
            isn't combined with personal information and can't be personally
            traced back to you. We may use IP addresses for analyzing patterns,
            managing the Website, keeping track of Usersâ€™ activity, and
            collecting general demographic information for aggregate use.
            EsportsEdge holds exclusive ownership of the information collected
            on this Website. We vow not to sell, share, or rent our Users'
            information differently from outlined in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>Application of the Collected Information</strong>
          </h5>

            EsportsEdge doesn't share your personal information with any third
            party without your explicit permission. However, by registering on
            our Website or Application, you grant us permission to use and
            disclose your personal information as outlined here. There could be

            information. We use your personal information to enhance our
            services, improve your experience on our site, and inform you about
            new Esports offers, products, and services. Select information might
            be shared with our sponsors and suppliers of rewards for our
            winners.
