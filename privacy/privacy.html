      <h2 id="InfoGathered">1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        ChildU collects data from students and their parents who interact with
        our online school in various ways. The specific personal information we
        require depends on your engagement with our site. For example, when
        enrolling in courses, we may need student and parent information for
        registration.

      <h2 id="InfoGuard">2. Securing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        At ChildU, your privacy is our top priority. However, it should be noted
        that no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage can be
        completely secure. While we have robust measures in place, we cannot
        guarantee the full security of your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="InfoProtection">3. Protecting Student Data</h2>

      <p>
        We only disclose student data to our staff and authorized entities who
        require such information to provide educational services through our
        platform. These entities may be located outside your country, and by
        using ChildU's online school, you consent to this data transfer. We
        disclose data in compliance with legal obligations or when necessary to
        protect the rights of ChildU, students, or public safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students and parents may occasionally receive information about new
        courses, special learning opportunities, and ChildU updates. Our online
        portal serves as our primary communication platform, reducing the
        frequency of direct emails. We take all necessary measures to prevent
        unauthorized access or misuse of personal data.

      <h2 id="CookiePolicy">4. Cookie Policy</h2>

      <p>
        ChildU uses "Cookies," along with other technologies and third-party
        services, to personalize learning experiences, deliver relevant content,
        and remember user preferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cookie is a piece of data sent from the site to the visitor's device,
        which is then sent back by the visitor's device each time they return to
        the site. Cookies help us better understand student and parent behavior,
        track engagement, and remember site preferences. Users who have concerns
        about cookies should adjust their browser settings before accessing
        ChildU's online school. Please note that disabling cookies may affect
        the site's functionality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuing to use our online school without changing your cookie
        settings signifies your agreement to ChildU's use of cookies.

      <h2 id="OnlineInteractions">5. Online Learning</h2>

      <p>
        When students and parents engage in online learning with ChildU, such as
        enrolling in courses, we may request additional personal information for
        educational purposes. This is solely to facilitate the learning
        experience at ChildU. We will not disclose personal data beyond what is
        stated in this policy. However, refusing to provide this required data
        may limit the ability to participate in certain educational activities
        on our website.
