        <h2 id="PIII">1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
        <p>
          Mystic Muse collects personally identifiable information (PII) from
          individuals who interact with our website in various ways. The nature
          of the interaction determines the extent of personal data we collect.
          As an example, we request email addresses and usernames from users who
          choose to leave a comment on our site.

        <h2 id="Securityy">2. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Data Security is our prime concern. However, it is crucial to point
          out that no data shared over the internet or stored digitally is 100%
          secure. Therefore, despite using cost-effective data protection
          techniques, it is impossible to assure the absolute security of your
          PII.

        <h2 id="PIIIProtectionn">3. Protection Measures of PII</h2>
        <p>
          We disclose PII only to those employees and partnering organizations
          that must process this information on behalf of Mystic Muse or to

          partnering organizations may reside outside your resident country and
          you, by using the Mystic Muse website, are providing consent to such
          information transfer. We only disclose potentially
          personally-identifying and personally-identifying information in
          response to a court order or other legal requests, or when we believe
          in good faith that disclosure is crucial to protect the rights of
          Mystic Muse, third parties or the public at large.
