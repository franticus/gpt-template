      <p>
        The Site discloses potentially personal identifying and personal
        identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and

        to process it on behalf of the Site or to provide services available at
        the Site's website, and (ii) have agreed not to disclose it to others.
        Some of these employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may
        be located outside your home country; by using the Site's website, you
        consent to the transfer of such information to them. The Site will not
        rent or sell potentially personal identifying and personal identifying
        information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and
        affiliated organizations, as described above, the Site discloses
        potentially personal identifying and personal identifying information
        only in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental
        request, or when the Site believes in good faith that disclosure is
        reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the Site,
        third parties, or the general public.

        happening with the Site and our products. We primarily use our blog to
        communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
        email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example, via a support
        email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
        publish it to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
        support other users. The Site takes all reasonably necessary measures to
        protect against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of
        potentially personal identifying and personal identifying information.
