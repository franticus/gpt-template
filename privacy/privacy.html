      <h2 id="InfoGathered">1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        ImmoNex collects data from clients who engage with our real estate
        agency in various ways. The specific personal information we require
        depends on your real estate needs and interactions with our services.
        For example, when engaging in real estate transactions, we may need
        client information for property listings and sales.

      <h2 id="InfoGuard">2. Securing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        At ImmoNex, your privacy is our top priority. However, it should be
        noted that no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage
        can be completely secure. While we have robust measures in place, we
        cannot guarantee the full security of your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="InfoProtection">3. Protecting Client Data</h2>

      <p>
        We only disclose client data to our staff and authorized entities who
        require such information to facilitate real estate transactions through
        our platform. These entities may be located outside your country, and by
        using ImmoNex's real estate services, you consent to this data transfer.
        We disclose data in compliance with legal obligations or when necessary
        to protect the rights of ImmoNex and the clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clients may occasionally receive information about new property
        listings, real estate opportunities, and ImmoNex updates. Our online
        portal serves as our primary communication platform, reducing the
        frequency of direct emails. We take all necessary measures to prevent
        unauthorized access or misuse of personal data.

        services, to personalize real estate experiences, deliver relevant
        property listings, and remember user preferences.
