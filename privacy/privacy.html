        </h2>
        <p>
          Site discloses potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
          contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know that
          information in order to process it on Site"s behalf or to provide
          services available at Site"s website, and that have agreed not to
          disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
          affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country;
          by using Site"s website, you consent to the transfer of such
          information to them. Site will not rent or sell potentially
          personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
          anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
          organizations, as described above, Site discloses potentially
          personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
          response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
          when Site believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
          necessary to protect the property or rights of Site, third parties or
          the public at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a registered user and have supplied your email address,
          Site may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
          features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
          what"s going on with Site and our products. We primarily use our blog
          to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
          type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
          a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
          right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
          request or to help us support other users. Site takes all measures
          reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
          alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information.
