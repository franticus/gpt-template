    <h2>Understanding Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are minuscule data files stored on your computer or handheld
      device when you access a website. These are largely incorporated to ensure
      greater efficiency of websites and to enrich user experience, as well as

    <h2>Our Utilization of Cookies</h2>
    <p>Our reasons for using cookies include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To enhance your website exploration by recalling your preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        To compile anonymous user behavior statistics for analytics purposes.
      </li>
      <li>To enable certain social media capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
