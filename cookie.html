            <br />CricWinnerTop is a daily fantasy esports betting application.
            This page pertains exclusively to the CricWinnerTop cookie policy.
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading"><strong>What are cookies?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Like most applications, CricWinnerTop uses cookies. Cookies are small
            text files stored on your device (computer, phone, tablet, or
            similar) to recognize it, remember preferences, gather statistics,
            and target advertisements. Cookies can include text, numbers or
            dates but not personal data. They pose no risk to your device (e.g.,
            they cannot carry a virus). The following data processors can access
            the stored data: Microsoft Ltd., Google Ltd., Match2One AB, and
            Facebook Ltd.<br />Usage of our app implies your consent for the use
            of cookies, including third party cookies. However, you can delete
            or block cookies at any time. Details about the cookies stored on
            your device through your use of our app can be found at the bottom
            of this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deleting or blocking cookies may result in less relevant
            advertisements for you and increased frequency of ad appearances.
            You may also find that the app doesn't function optimally and there
            may be content you can't access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies are also used in compiling log files from the app’s users.
            Like all digital platforms, we generate log files which contain an
            overview of 1) the app screens visited, 2) when they were accessed,
            and 3) the geographical location based on IP address. We can see
            only the city of access, not your precise location. Further
            information about our personal data processing, including your IP
            address, can be found in our privacy policy.<br />These log files
            are used for monitoring traffic and as a security measure. For
            example, IP addresses help us to prevent hacker attacks.<br />Log
            files, including IP-addresses are stored for 5 years before they are
            deleted.<br />We use cookies to a variety of ends, like optimizing
            our marketing strategies, improving user experience, and enhancing
            the technical functionality of our app.<br />The data we gather
            through cookies is used to study user behavior on the app. The
            collected data helps us to optimize our marketing efforts, improve
            user experience, perfectly tailor our app and target online ads, and
            make the app more functional for its users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of cookies enables ongoing adaptations to the app to better
            meet user needs as identified through their behavior. Alongside us,
            certain third parties also install cookies on your device during the
            use of the app. More details about the third parties can be found
            under "Third party plugins that leave cookies".
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>What cookies do we use?</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            A list of cookies that are stored on your device when you use our
            app is located at the bottom of this page. In the following, we will
            detail different types of cookies. For instance, the app
            periodically uses heat maps, which trace user activity throughout
            the app. This data and associated information will be stored. Heat
            maps are a tool utilized to understand user movement on the app,
            which aids in optimization efforts.
          </p>
          <h4 class="heading">
            <strong>Cookies used for analysis</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            CricWinnerTop uses "Google Analytics" and "Matomo" to ascertain the
            geographical regions from which users access the app. This is gauged
            via the users’ IP-addresses. The geographic location data is
            primarily utilized to ensure that we don't serve users from areas
            where online betting is prohibited.<br />The app also compiles
            anonymous statistics about the number of visits, the average time
            spent on the app, and which screens were accessed. This data helps
            us to tailor online ads to our audience.
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>Targeted advertising</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            When using CricWinnerTop, cookies are stored on your device to enable
            targeted and relevant online advertising on platforms like Facebook
            and Instagram, and on other websites. You might also see our banner
            ads displayed on other websites.<br />Targeted marketing efforts
            cease no later than 180 days from your last app visit. You can also
            avoid targeted ads by deleting or blocking cookies.<br />Third party
            plugins on the app, such as embedded Youtube videos, may also leave
            a cookie on your device. These come from third party services on the
            app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of third-party cookies include: Youtube – May occur on the
            app due to embedded videos.<br />These features are included to
            provide users with additional features (such as videos) and other
            benefits.
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>How long do we store user information?</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Information on users’ interaction with our app is stored up to 26
            months in Google Analytics. If a user accesses the app again within
            26 months, the storage period restarts from that moment—a practice
            known as 'data retention'.<br />The collected data does not contain
            any personal information of the users. They aim to provide our users
            the best possible experience on our app.<br />Google Analytics data
            is stored up to 26 months to enable the generation of annual site
            development statistics, to retain comparable historical data, and to
            measure the site’s traffic.<br />Information related to users who
            have interacted with or visited the app via Facebook Marketing will
            be stored in a Facebook Pixel for up to 180 days, abiding by
            Facebook’s guidelines. All data is anonymised by Facebook.<br />The
            use of the Facebook Pixel aims to target ads and marketing from the
            site via Facebook and to present users with ads that match their
            interests and needs.

          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>How can I avoid cookies?</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            If you do not wish to store cookies on your device, you can delete
            them at any time. This process is simple and quick. A guide to
            deleting cookies can be found at the following link:
            https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en<br />To
            prevent your device from storing cookies while you are online, you
            can choose to block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie
            is stored. You can find a guide on how to change your browser
