            <br />CricWinnerTop is an innovative platform offering fantasy
            sports management where sports enthusiasts can leverage their
            knowledge of the game. Our application allows users to assemble
            their team from real players, compete against others, and earn
            points based on real player performances in upcoming matches without
            placing any bets. This page explains the cookie policy of the
            CricWinnerTop application.

          <h5 class="heading"><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            As with many applications, CricWinnerTop utilizes cookies. Cookies
            are small text files that are placed on your device (computer,
            phone, tablet, etc.) to recognize it, store preferences, compile
            statistics, and deliver targeted advertising. These files are made
            up of text, numbers, or dates but do not contain personal
            information, hence they cannot compromise the safety of your device
            (such as spreading a virus). Access to this data is available to
            certain data processors, including Microsoft Ltd., Google Ltd.,
            Match2One AB, and Facebook Ltd.
            <br />Your use of our application indicates your acceptance of the
            use of cookies, encompassing third-party cookies as well.
            Nevertheless, you have the option to delete or block cookies at any
            moment. Further details about the cookies used through our
            application are provided at the end of this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be aware that deleting or blocking cookies may lead to suboptimal
            app performance, potentially repetitive advertisements, and
            inaccessible content.
          </p>
          <p>
            We utilize cookies to compile log files of user interactions within
            the app. Like all digital services, these logs provide a summary of
            visited screens, usage timings, and geographical locations derived
            from IP addresses; however, we only ascertain the city of access.
            More details about our personal data processing, which includes IP
            addresses, can be accessed in our privacy policy.
            <br />These logs serve as a tool for traffic analysis and as a
            safeguard, such as helping to thwart hacker activities. <br />IP
            address logs and associated data are retained for 5 years before
            deletion. <br />The overall purpose of our cookie usage encompasses
            marketing strategy optimization, user experience enhancement, and
            app functionality improvement. <br />The information gleaned through
            cookies provides invaluable insights into user behavior, which
            guides the refining of our marketing efforts and user experience,
            ensures the app's personalized finesse, targets online ads
            accurately, and heightens the application's utility for our
            audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookie usage enables us to continually refine the app according to
            user behavior insights. During your use of our app, certain
            third-parties also place cookies on your device. You can find more
            information on these parties under "Third-party plugins leaving
            cookies."
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>What Cookies Do We Use?</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            A summary of the cookies stored on your device by our app can be
            located at the bottom of this page. We use an array of cookies for
            different reasons; for example, heat maps tracing user activity
            throughout the app are periodically utilized and this information is
            stored.
            <br />Heat maps are instrumental in comprehending user navigation
            and interaction on the app, which assists in our ongoing
            optimization process.
          </p>
          <h4 class="heading">
            <strong>Cookies Used for Analysis</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            CricWinnerTop employs tools such as "Google Analytics" and "Matomo"
            to assess where our users are accessing the app from, using their IP
            addresses. The collected geographic data ensures we operate within
            regions where fantasy sports are allowed.
            <br />Additionally, we compile anonymized statistics on visit
            counts, duration of app usage, and accessed screens, which underpins
            our tailored advertising strategies.
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>Targeted Advertising</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Throughout your experience with CricWinnerTop, your device stores
            cookies enabling targeted advertising across various platforms such
            as Facebook and Instagram, as well as other websites. These
            advertisements may also appear as banner ads on third-party sites.
            <br />Our targeted marketing activities are discontinued no later
            than 180 days after your last visit to the app. To avoid targeted
            advertisements, you can opt to delete or block cookies.
            <br />Third-party plugins incorporated into our app, for example,
            YouTube videos embedded within content, may also place cookies on
            your device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of third-party cookies include but are not limited to:
            <br />Youtube â€“ Can be stored due to any integrated video content on
            the app. <br />The integration of these features is meant to enrich
            user experience by offering additional functionalities, such as
            video playback.
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>How Long Do We Store User Information?</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Data involving user interaction with our app is stored within Google
            Analytics for a maximum of 26 months. This retention period restarts
            each time a user revisits the app, a process known as 'data
            retention'.
            <br />The aggregated data is anonymous and focuses on enhancing the
            user experience on our app. <br />We retain Google Analytics data
            for 26 months to facilitate the development of annual statistics, to
            maintain historical comparability, and to analyze traffic patterns.
            <br />Interactions related to users who have visited the app through
            Facebook Marketing are recorded in a Facebook Pixel for a period up
            to 180 days, in compliance with Facebook's policies. All such data
            is anonymized by Facebook. <br />The rationale behind the Facebook
            Pixel is to customize site advertising on Facebook, ensuring users
            receive ads that are more aligned with their preferences and
            interests.
          </p>
          <h5 class="heading">

          </h5>
