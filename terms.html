            <strong>Competitions, Participation and Rewards</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            At present, EsportsEdge offers premium versions of the Competitions,
            where participants, known as Gamblers, can take part by paying the
            specified amount mentioned on the relevant Competition page. The
            Gambler with the most points acquired at the conclusion of the
            defined eSports round votes becomes eligible to receive a
            pre-decided reward, as listed on the relevant Competitions page. A
            Gambler can formulate different Betting Strategies for participation
            in the Competitions associated with an eSports match across the
            EsportsEdge Services. However, unless EsportsEdge specifies
            otherwise for any Competition (“Multiple Entry Competition”),
            Gamblers accept that they can place stakes only on one Team in any
            Competition associated with an eSports match. In a Multiple Entry
            Competition situation, a player may place bets on more than one
            Team, however, the gambler can’t modify the bet on more than one
            Team once the stake has been placed. It must be clearly understood,
            that EsportsEdge may at times limit the maximum number of Betting
            Strategies that a single gambler account could create (for each type
            of EsportsEdge Services) or which a single gambler account may enter
            in a specific Multiple Entry Competition, as determined by
            EsportsEdge in its sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            EsportsEdge will gather a pre-decided fee for access to EsportsEdge
            Services from every participant in regards to the Competitions. If a
            Gambler, while registering an address, indicates their residence in
            Assam, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim or Telangana, such Gambler will not
            be granted permission to sign up for the round or competition and
            may not participate in any paid version of the Competitions.
          </p>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge offers Competitions in two separate formats – (1) Public
            competition where Gamblers can participate in a Competition with
            other Gamblers without any restriction, and (2) Private competitions
            where Gamblers can invite specific individuals for a Competition and
            limit participation to such chosen individuals. Both formats follow
            the same Contest regulation outlined herein.
          </p>

          <h5 class="heading"><strong>Public competition</strong></h5>

          <p>
            In the public competition format, EsportsEdge may offer Competitions
            for 2, 3, 5, 10, 100 Gamblers or any other pre-determined number of
            Gamblers.
          </p>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge may offer this as a paid format where the Winner will be
            determined at the end of the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            The required number of Gamblers to make the Competition operational
            will be pre-specified. When the number of Gamblers in the
            Competitions matches the pre-specified requisite, the Competitions
            begins. If the number of Gamblers is less than the pre-specified
            requisite at the time of the start of the round, the Competition
            will not start and the fee paid by every Gambler will be returned to
            their account without any charges or deductions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Competitions within the EsportsEdge Services, labeled as
            “Confirmed Competitions”, will be operational once the number of
            Gamblers in particular match hit the pre-specified number of winners
            to be declared, even if all available Gambler slots remain unfilled.
            It is clarified that regardless of the activation of such
            Competitions, Gamblers can continue to join till either all Gambler
            slots are filled or the match relevant to the Competition starts,
            whichever is earlier. If the Competitions are not operational when
            the match begins, the participation fee paid by each User will be
            returned to the Gambler's account without any charge or deduction.
          </p>

          <h5 class="heading"><strong>Private competition</strong></h5>

          <p>
            The private competition format of the Competitions allows Gamblers
            to establish a private competition (“Private competition”) and
            invite other existing or new gamblers (“Invited Gambler”) to make
            Betting Strategies and participate. Gamblers can create their
            Private competition with pre-specified Gambler numbers, that could
            be 2, 3, 5, or 10. When creating a Private competition, the Gambler
            has to pay the participation fee, provide a name for the
            competition, and will be given a unique identification code for the
            competition. Once the Private competition is created, no changes
            will be allowed in its terms or structure, except for the
            competition name. The Gambler creating the Private competition shall
            provide the email address or Facebook account username of Invited
            Gamblers to enable EsportsEdge to send an invitation to register
            with EsportsEdge (if needed) and participate in the competition for
            which the invitation is extended.
          </p>

          <p>
            To participate in the Private competition, an Invited Gambler should
            input the competition code and pay the participation fee. Only when
            the number of participants equals the pre-specified number, the
            Private competition will be operational, and no more Invited
            Gamblers or Gamblers will be allowed to participate. If a Private
            competition doesn't gather the required participant number within 1
            hour before the match begins, Gamblers in such a competition will be
            provided an option to convert it into a Public competition format.
            In such converted Competitions, if the number of Participants is
            less than the pre-specified number when the match commences,
            participation fees will be returned to all Gamblers with no charges
            or deductions. EsportsEdge will not be responsible for the
            non-participation of invited Gamblers due to any cause, including
            technical hitches or ineligible Gamblers.
          </p>

          <h5 class="heading"><strong>Eligibility</strong></h5>

          <p>
            The Competitions are accessible solely to persons above 18 years and
            residing in India. Participants must possess a valid email address.
            Only those Gamblers who have successfully registered with
            EsportsEdge, as well as signed up for each round as per the outlined
            procedure, will be eligible to take part in the Competition and earn
            prizes.
          </p>

          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>Payment Terms and Gamblers Fund</strong>
          </h5>

            participation in premium games are made through their EsportsEdge
            user account. All cash prizes won by Gamblers are credited by us
            into this user account. Deposits to user accounts should be done
            responsibly. EsportsEdge reserves the right to set deposit limits
            subject to conditions it deems appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Payments via credit card, debit card, prepaid cash cards, and
            internet banking are processed through third-party payment gateways.
            We bear no responsibility for any delays or denials at the end of
            the payment intermediary. In these situations, Gamblers may contact
            us following the “Complaints and disputes” procedure. We reserve the
            right to cancel a transaction at any time and reverse funds to the
            payment instrument if necessary. Player funds are held in trust by
            us in designated bank accounts, separate from our corporate funds.
            Even in the unlikely event of insolvency, your claims on the
            deposits will be prioritized to the extent permissible by law.
          </p>

          <h5 class="heading"><strong>Withdrawals</strong></h5>

          <p>
            Gamblers may withdraw their winnings either through an account payee
            check or an electronic bank transfer.
          </p>

          <h5 class="heading">
            <strong>The following conditions apply to all withdrawals:</strong>
          </h5>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge may request KYC documents for address and identity
            verification at any stage, and withdrawals will only be permitted
            from accounts where the KYC process is completed. Winning are
            transferrable only after the minimum time requirements since the
            deposit have been fulfilled, and the winnings must have been used
            for betting. Once notified of a withdrawal request and following
            verification, we may disburse the requested amount via cheque or
            electronic transfer, with the understanding that we reserve the
            right to use cheque for payout and can utilize the financial
            instrument used for the deposit. While we aim to process withdrawals
            promptly, there can potentially be delays due to the time required
            for verification and transaction completion. EsportsEdge holds no
            liability to pay any compensation for transactional delays.
          </p>

          <h5 class="heading"><strong>Tallying of Fantasy Points</strong></h5>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge may get the score feed necessary for the calculation and
            tallying of betting points from third-party service providers. In
            the rare occurrence of any discrepancy in the tally of betting
            points, or the selection of winners due to inaccuracies in the feed
            provided by the third-party service provider, EsportsEdge will
            rectify such errors before distributing prizes. However, we depend
            on the accuracy of this third-party score/statistic feeds and
            assumes no responsibility for any inaccuracies and computes and
            tally gambling points and award winners. Gamblers should not make
            any claim or complaint against EsportsEdge in this regard.
          </p>

              Conditions</strong
            >
          </h5>

          <p>
            Winners are selected based on points scored by the Teams in a
            specific round of eSports matches. The Gamblers who own the Teams
            with the highest cumulative scores are declared the Winners. In
            pre-specified Competitions, EsportsEdge may announce more than one
            Winner and allocate prizes on an ascending sequence of their Teams'
            cumulative scores at the end of the match. The expected number of
            Winners and the prize for each Winner is specified on the
            Competition page at the outset of the Competition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants placing bets on behalf of another participant will be
            disqualified.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a tie occurs, all Participants in the tie are declared Winners
            and the prize money is split among them equally.
          </p>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge has the right to withhold any prize payment if there are
            suspicions that the Winners have not adhered to the EsportsEdge
            Terms of Use, Competition terms, Betting Rules, etc.
          </p>

          <p>Contacting Winners</p>

          <p>
            Winners will be contacted by EsportsEdge or the third party
            conducting the Contest via the e-mail address provided during
            registration. Details regarding the verification process and
            necessary documentation for claiming prizes will then be provided.
            Additional documents may be requested for this process such as:
          </p>

          <p>A government-issued residential proof;</p>
          <p>Gambler’s PAN card;</p>
          <p>Gambler’s bank account details and proof thereof.</p>

          <p>
            Failure to submit these within the given timeframe will prevent
            withdrawal or receipt of winnings. Incomplete or misleading details
            at the time of registration may also lead to communication
            hindrances. No compensation will be given for communication
            irregularities resulting from participant errors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Frequently, winners will be asked to provide the following
            documents: PAN Card, Government-issued residential proof, and bank
            account documentation. EsportsEdge retains the right to restrict the
            withdrawal of the accumulated winnings unless these documents have
            been received, verified, and completed within the timeframe
            specified by EsportsEdge.
          </p>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge evaluates all documents provided. In certain instances,
            EsportsEdge may disqualify a Winner from withdrawing their winnings
            due to reasons such as erroneous or misleading documents,
            non-compliance with the Eligibility Criteria, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            All prizes are non-transferable and non-refundable, and no cash
            requests can be made in lieu of prizes.
          </p>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge reserves the right to alter or modify the prizes offered
            to winners. Participants cannot make any claims against EsportsEdge
            or question its right to modify such prizes that have been offered
            prior to closing the Competition.
          </p>

          <p>
            EsportsEdge assumes no responsibility for transportation or
            packaging of prizes to respective winners and will not be
            responsible for any loss or damages during transit. Winners will
            bear the associated costs of delivery such as shipping and courier
            charges, as well as transaction charges levied for delivering cash
            prizes.
          </p>

          <p>
            All complaints about deposit-related issues will follow the
            “Complaints and Disputes” procedure. In the unlikely event that your
            credit is delayed or denied due to circumstances beyond our control,
            we will not be considered responsible in any manner.
          </p>
          <p>Verification process</p>
          <p>
            Only those Winners who successfully pass the verification process
            and provide the necessary paperwork within the time limit set by
            EsportsEdge will be allowed to withdraw/receive their collected
            winnings (or any portion thereof). EsportsEdge will not consider any
            demands or requests for additional time for submission of documents.
          </p>
          <p>

            its sole and unrestricted discretion, disqualify any Winner from
            withdrawing their accumulated winnings (or any part thereof) based
            on the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The decision by EsportsEdge that any document or information
              submitted by the User is incorrect, misleading, false, fabricated,
              incomplete or unreadable; or the User does not fulfil the
              Eligibility Criteria specified in Clause 10 above; or any other
              ground.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a User engaged in the paid portions of the Betting Games is
              found to be under the age of eighteen (18), EsportsEdge reserves
              the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to disqualify such
              User and forfeit their prize. Additionally, EsportsEdge may, at
              its sole discretion, suspend or terminate such User's account.
            </li>
            <li>
              In accordance with law, EsportsEdge offers no guarantees regarding

            </li>
            <li>
              EsportsEdge may, in its sole and unrestricted discretion, alter or
              amend the rewards being provided to winners. Users shall not

              adjust such rewards being offered, prior to the conclusion of the
              Betting Game.
            </li>
            <li>

              The Winners shall cover the postage, courier, or any other
              delivery costs concerning the rewards.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Winners are responsible for all transaction charges imposed
              for delivery of cash rewards.
            </li>
            <li>
