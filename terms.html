            The local regulations in the Indian states of Assam, Nagaland,
            Odisha, Sikkim, and Telangana prohibit individuals from engaging in
            the fantasy sports services provided on our platform. Any
            infringement of these laws might be subject to penalties enforced by
            the State or Central Government of India. Our company, along with
            CricWinnerTop, disallows the registration and participation of
            individuals residing in Assam, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, and
            Telangana. If a user from these states joins CricWinnerTop using
            deceitful information (false state disclosure, IP masking, etc.),
            the responsibility will lie solely with the user. We reserve the
            right to close such accounts immediately, and also retain the right
            to retain any credits or winnings in such cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term ‘Services’ as used in this document pertains to all the
            facilities/services offered by the fantasy sports platform
            CricWinnerTop to a registered user or 'Player'. 'Us’, 'We’, or 'Our’
            refer to Ability and/or its affiliates, subsidiaries, associates,
            and partners that operate the platform. The use of the platform by
            any user is subject to the stated Terms of Service, hereafter
            referred to as 'Terms'.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is imperative for 'YOU' to peruse these Terms in their entirety
            before accessing or utilizing the 'Services'. If any clause within
            these Terms is adjudged as unlawful, invalid, or for any reason
            unenforceable by a judiciary or quasi-judicial body in India, it
            will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining
            provisions. The ineffective Terms will be substituted with an
            enforceable clause that reflects the initial intent as closely as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            By registering on CricWinnerTop, it is assumed that you have
            reviewed these terms thoroughly and have abided by them. It is
            recommended to keep printed copies of all transaction history, game
            rules, cancellation policies, and methods of payment. Failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms on our
            part shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision for
            any future instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should these Terms, or any future changes to these Terms, be
            unacceptable to you, please cease use of the application and its
            Services immediately.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Any violation of these Terms, or if there is evidence of fraudulent
            activity, gives us the right to limit or terminate your access to
            services, delete your accounts and associated information, and take
            appropriate legal and technical steps.

            CricWinnerTop’s mistake or fault, we will refund such platform fees.
            Conversely, no refund will be due if such suspension or termination
            was due to a breach of these Terms by the player.
